## Traffic Density Estimation Project Overview**

This project capitalizes on the real-time detection strengths of YOLO to concentrate on estimating traffic density, a crucial aspect of urban and traffic administration. Its main objective is to enumerate vehicles in designated areas across each video frame, facilitating an evaluation of traffic congestion. The gathered information is instrumental in pinpointing high-traffic intervals and areas of congestion, thereby contributing to urban development planning. The endeavor is geared towards creating an extensive toolkit that offers in-depth analysis of traffic movement and trends, ultimately improving strategies for traffic control and urban planning.

## Project Objectives

1. **Selection and Preliminary Evaluation of YOLOv8**: Initiating the project with the selection of a pre-trained YOLOv8 model, followed by an initial evaluation of its performance on the COCO dataset specifically for vehicle detection tasks.

2. **Creation of a Specialized Vehicle Dataset**: Developing a curated and annotated dataset focused on vehicles. This dataset aims to improve the model's capability to recognize various types of vehicles accurately.

3. **Fine-Tuning the Model for Superior Vehicle Detection**: Applying transfer learning to adjust the YOLOv8 model for enhanced detection of vehicles, particularly from aerial views, to achieve better precision and recall in the detection process.

4. **In-Depth Evaluation of Model Performance**: Conducting a thorough assessment of the model through the analysis of learning curves, a confusion matrix, and other performance metrics to ensure the model's accuracy and its ability to generalize across different scenarios.

5. **Testing Model Inference and Generalization**: Evaluating the model's generalization capabilities on a set of validation images, an unseen test image, and a test video to showcase its practical utility and effectiveness in real-world applications.

6. **Real-Time Traffic Density Analysis**: Implementing an algorithm capable of estimating traffic density in real time by counting vehicles and assessing traffic intensity through analysis of test video data.

7. **Preparation for Cross-Platform Deployment**: Preparing the fine-tuned model for deployment across various platforms by exporting it in ONNX format, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration into different software environments.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Watching the Real-Time Performance

Witness the real-time traffic analysis capability of our YOLOv8 model:

#### Install Ultralytics YOLO
Ensure you have the ultralytics package installed by running:
```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

#### Run the Analysis Script
With the Ultralytics package installed, you're ready to execute the script that powers the real-time traffic density estimation. Run the following command from the root directory of the project:
```bash
python Real_time_analysis.py
```

#### Real-Time Analysis
Once the script is running, a video window will open, displaying the live traffic analysis. This window will show the YOLOv8 model in action, detecting vehicles and estimating traffic density in real time.

To close the video window and exit the analysis, simply press 'q' while the video window is active.
